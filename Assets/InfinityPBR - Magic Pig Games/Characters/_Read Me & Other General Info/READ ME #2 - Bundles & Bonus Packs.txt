Thank you for supporting our work!

DECEMBER 2024 UPDATE
My packs contain shared scripts, shaders, and other content, which is kept up to date in the "Support Files" package (free) on the Asset Store:

https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/utilities/infinity-pbr-support-files-160921?aid=1100lxWw

Please install the support files package to ensure you have the latest versions of all shared content. Any errors or issues after initial import are likely due to missing support files.

BUNDLE PACKS
These packs have no real content in them, but rather provide the ability to purchase the individual packs for free. Each bundle will list and link to individual packs and bonus packs in the description on the bundle page on the Asset Store.

PACKS WITH BONUS CONTENT
Many, or most, of our work comes with "Bonus" content. This is things like source files, sometimes additional textures, and more. Once you have the entitlement for the main package, you can "buy" the bonus packs for free. 

Each package will list all bonus packs included in the description on the Asset Store.
